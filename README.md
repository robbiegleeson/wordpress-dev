## Getting Started

This is a fairly simple project to get up and running.  
The procedure for starting up a working WordPress is as follows:

1. Clone the project.  (Thereâ€™s only master branch.)
2. Run `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater` from command line
2. Run the command `vagrant up` from the directory
3. Open your browser to http://vagrantpress.dev

## Working with the environment

To log in to the local Wordpress installation:

`http://vagrantpress.dev/wp-admin/` the username is `admin`, the password is `vagrant`.

You can access phpMyAdmin:

`http://vagrantpress.dev/phpmyadmin/` with username `wordpress`, password `wordpress`.

## A Few Details

* If you're needing a password (for anything - including mysql, it should be `vagrant`)

## Get your theme!

Now you're Wordpress install is up and running it's time to roll your own theme. Head over to [Underscores.me] (http://underscores.me/), enter in your theme name and hit Generate.

Drop the theme into the themes directory (wordpress/wp-content/themes) and unzip it!

Go to your wp-admin and set your theme and that's it- get coding (ugh and styling!)
